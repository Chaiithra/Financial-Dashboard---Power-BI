# Financial-Dashboard---Power-BI
We use the financials data to showcase important metrics, KPI, and multiple visualizations to create this dashboard. 
## Step - 1: ##
We create a new table named "Analysis", where we'll be creating multiple measures required for the metric calculations and KPI.
The following are the measures we create here:
1. Sales Amount
2. Orders
3. Profit
4. Profit Margin %
5. Discount Offered
## Step - 2: ##
Time Intelligence Calculations are made in this step.
It enables us to compare KPI off different time periods.
The list of calculations made are as follows:
1. Sales Amount LY (Last Year)
2. Orders LY
3. Profit LY
4. Profit Margin LY
5. Discount Offered LY.                                                                                                                                                       
And, we also format each of these calculations respectively.
## Step - 3: ##
We customize the report theme as it saves us a lot of time and effort.
We can make a base layout here, which will be filled soon with data and graphs.
## Step - 4: ##
Firstly, we use the "chart" Visualization to showcase all KPI. And, then modify them accordingly for eg: For this dashboard, we removed the titles from X-axis, Y-axis and General. And added title separately in a text box. For some visusalizations we added data labels too.
Secondly, we now make all the 6 major visualizations which are : 
1. Orders by Country
2. Profit Margin by Country
3. Percentage of Discount offered by Discount Band
4. Profit Margin by Segment ( Conditional Formatting is used )
5. Sales Amount by Year and Month
6. Top 3 products by Sales ( Conditional Formatting is used ).                                                                                                              
Finally, we make the most critical information carrying Matrix named as " Profit Margin by Segment and Profit ". In this Matrix, Rows are Segment and Product, Values are Profit Margin. We also add 3 icons here, each of those description can be understood from the Dashboard.
In this way, the "Financials Dashboard" is created.
